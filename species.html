        <div class="px-4">
          <p>The first ever Dretoni was created by Princess Luna, before she was trapped away on the moon, as she had found out that taking care of every ponies dreams alone was a very heavy burden. The place where these dreams of every pony reside in is called, The Dreamscape, which consists of dream sand. But what also resides in it, that Luna is trying to keep at bay, are Nightmares. These nightmares had become abnormal and were proving to be more dificult than Luna thought. So she came to the conclusion that she needed assistance, the desire to protect her subjects gave her the willpower and strength to come up with these creations, The Dretoni Species. </p>
        <p>And so before she was banished to the moon, Luna had this last wish....</p>
        <p>"Dream without fear...."</p>

        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3">-ˏˋ⋆ Relation to the Physical World ⋆ˊˎ-</h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>The dreamcatchers of the physical world, act as portals for the species, allowing them to travel to the dreamer and spread a small amount of dreamsand over them to ease their sleeping forms. Although doing this doesn't completely stop the dreamer from having nightmares, it can help lessen and/or weaken them. As The Original Dretoni is creating the others, sometimes whatever portal is closest can create certain design attributes, as well as whatever may be happening on in the physical world. Dretoni are naturally palm sized when first created, as well as not being seen by the ponies when traveling to their world. However, when their strength becomes on par with The Original, not only are they the size of a pony but can also be seen by them.</p>

        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3">-ˏˋ⋆ Lifestyle ⋆ˊˎ-</h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>This species was originally created to hunt nightmares and protect the equestrians dreams. Although, as their numbers grew, some took a step back from hunting and decided to assist in other ways. Some of these Dretonis took on roles to further bettering the species way of life, such as helping train the younger generation in tactics to hunt faster and better, or help expand their territories. As their number continue to grow and as they make more advancements, they have formed and continue to uphold certain traditions.

        <h5 class="text-secondary mb-3">✧. ┊ The Euclin Ceremony</h5>
        <p>This Ceremony consists of two Dretonis, who have formed a close bond with eachother, to come together and decide to have a "child" of their own. The "Parents" use some of their dreamsand and form Life Beads, which then later get presented to Blanc and so he combines both the life beads, as well as his own special magic, to create the new Sandlets. The following day is usually full of celebration in the name of the new generation.</p>

<div class="text-left p-3">
        <h5 class="text-secondary mb-3">✧. ┊ Aeros Tradition</h5>
        <p>This tradition is done during every full moon by all communities. Even though Dretoni cannot reproduce whatsoever, they do take this time to go out and form romantic bonds. Sometimes they express their love by creating a smaller version of the Life Bead and gifting it or they also tend to create accessories out of their dreamsand.</p>

 <h3 class="text-primary mb-3">-ˏˋ⋆ Dretoni Communities ⋆ˊˎ-</h3>
<div class="text-left p-3">
        <h5 class="text-secondary mb-3">✧. ┊ Certec⁭</h5>
        <p>The original group formed when Dretoni were first being created. Eventually, when they became more diverse and Dretoni began to branch off, they became the center hub for the species. Certec is most commonly known as the commerce of all the communities, and it's considered a peace grounds for them. Because peace is important, they have a group that protects their community, making it safer for all the Dretoni who choose to reside there. </p>
       
        </div>
<div class="text-left p-3">
        <h5 class="text-secondary mb-3">✧. ┊ Bezotic⁭</h5>
        <p>A community that works mostly on growing stronger together. They believe in everyone living there growing in strength, usually through means of hunting strongest nightmares they can find. Though often compared to the Dretoni that cannibalize as a way to try to gain strength, they find that action especially taboo and will punish those who feast on others. </p>
       <li> When sandlets of this community reach a certain strength level, they are sent out to test that strength as well as to prove it. </li>
        <li> This process is called The Evolution Right and beforehand, a member of higher up creates an accessory of dreamsand to give to the sandlets as a way to give them a boost, should there be a time of need. In the swirling unknown of the Dreamscape, they endure many tests and challenges, however when they return, they are stronger and welcomed back as true members of the Bezotic⁭ community. </li>
</div>

<div class="text-left p-3">
        <h5 class="text-secondary mb-3">✧. ┊ Yaevit⁭⁭</h5>
        <p>This community specifically decided to learn more about the equestrian world outside of the dreamscape. Dretoni don't usually have an intense interest with the physical world, their leader’s stories and accumulated knowledge sparked a growing curiosity among them. Because they do not have protectors of their own, Bezotic teams regularly patrol their area.</p>
       <li>This curiosity is continued through festivals dedicated to storytelling and the preservation of history, where Dretoni gather to recount dreams, record knowledge, and share tales of the physical world. These celebrations serve not only as entertainment, but as a way to ensure knowledge is passed down through generations. </li>
        </div>
      <p>Although all groups have different goals and lifestyles, they all worship and thank the Creator as well as Princess Luna but tend to see the creator as a sort of mother to them all. All groups will have either a big shrine or a few smaller shrines for wishing and giving offers. There are more groups out there but these are the main 3 that are more prominent.  </p>
